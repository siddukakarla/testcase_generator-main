Problem Name:
Subset sum

Problem Statement:
For every testcase, you will be given an array of integers of size n and an integer k. If there exists a subset in the array whose sum is equal to k

Constraints:
1 <= t <= 100
1 <= n <= 10
1 <= ar[i], k <= 1e9

Input Format:
The first line of the input consists of the number of testcases t. The following t*2 lines are the testcases. The first line of the testcase are 2 integers n and k. Following line has n space separated integers which are the elements of the array.

Output Format:
Print "YES" if there is a subset with sum k, else print "NO"
