Problem Name:
Demy and Computers

Problem Statement:
Avinash owns N computers (numbered 11 through N). He wishes to sell all of them over N years by selling exactly one computer per year. For each valid i, the initial price of the i-th computer is Pi. Due to depreciation, the price of each computer decreases by 11 unit per year until it is sold.

Note that the price of a computer cannot drop below 0 no matter how many years have passed, i.e. when the price of a computer reaches 0 in some year, it remains 0 in all subsequent years.

Find the maximum profit Avinash can make if he sells his computers in an optimal way. Since this number may be large, compute it modulo 1e9+7

Constraints:
1 <= t <= 25
1 <= n <= 1e5
1 <= ar[i] <= 1e9

The sum of lengths of all the arrays will not exceed 2e6

Input Format:
The first line consists of the number of testcases t followed by 2t lines. In each testcase, the first line has a single integer n and second line has n space separated integers.

Output Format:
Output a single integer for each testcase.
