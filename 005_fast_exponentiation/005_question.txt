Problem Name:
Fast Exponentiation

Problem Statement:
For each testcase, you will be given 2 integers a and b. Compute a power b (a multiplied by itself for b times)

Constraints:
1 <= t <= 1e6
1 <= a <= 1e7
1 <= b <= 1e14

Input Format:
The first line comprises of the number of testcases(t). The following t lines each has 2 numbers a and b.


Output Format:
Print a single integer i.e. the value of a power b.
